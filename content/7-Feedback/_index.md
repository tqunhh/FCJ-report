The company provides a comfortable and professional working environment. Everyone is friendly, easy to communicate with, and always willing to support when problems arise. The workspace is tidy and quiet, which helps me stay focused and work more efficiently.

During the internship, I developed not only technical skills but also important soft skills such as teamwork, time management, and professional communication. The practical experiences and insights shared by the mentor were highly valuable and helped shape my future career direction.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company fosters a positive working culture that emphasizes collaboration and mutual respect. During high-pressure periods, team members consistently supported one another, making me feel respected and treated as a real member of the team rather than just an intern.
