During my internship at Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd. from September 8, 2025 to December 9, 2025, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired at university in a real working environment.

I directly participated in the Travel Journal project, which focuses on building a serverless web application on the AWS platform. Through this project, I was able to apply academic knowledge to practical scenarios while gaining exposure to teamwork and project implementation processes. As a result, my skills in programming, report writing, communication, and teamwork were significantly improved.

In terms of work attitude, I consistently made efforts to complete assigned tasks effectively, complied with company regulations, and actively communicated with colleagues to enhance overall work efficiency.

However, during the internship, I recognized that I still need to further improve my discipline in time management as well as my problem-solving mindset, particularly when dealing with complex situations.

Overall, the internship provided me with valuable hands-on experience, increased my confidence in engaging with real-world technology projects, and served as an important foundation for further developing both my technical skills and professional working attitude in the future.

To objectively reflect my internship experience, I hereby conduct a self-assessment based on the following criteria:
